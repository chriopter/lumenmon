# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Lumenmon is a lightweight system monitoring solution with SSH transport and TUI dashboard. It consists of two main components:
- **Console**: Central monitoring dashboard with SSH server and TUI interface
- **Agent**: Metrics collector that sends data to console via SSH

## CLI Commands

### Production Commands (`lumenmon`)
```bash
lumenmon              # Open TUI (or show status if not running)
lumenmon status       # Show comprehensive system status
lumenmon logs         # Stream logs from all containers
lumenmon invite       # Generate agent enrollment invite
lumenmon update       # Update from git repository
lumenmon uninstall    # Remove all containers and data

# Short aliases available: s (status), l (logs), i (invite), u (update), h (help)
```

### Status Output
- **Console**: Shows SSH key, service port, authorized keys, active invites, connected agents, active agents
- **Agent**: Shows SSH key, agent ID, console config, network connectivity, host fingerprint, SSH connection, metrics flow

### Development Commands
```bash
# Full auto-setup: reset, start containers, register agent, and launch TUI
./dev/auto

# Individual commands
./dev/start      # Start console and agent containers
./dev/stop       # Stop all containers
./dev/reset      # Clean everything and restart fresh
./dev/register   # Register agent with console (requires invite URL)
./dev/tui        # Launch TUI dashboard
./dev/logs       # Show container logs
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
# Build and run console
docker compose -f console/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# Build and run agent (with local console)
CONSOLE_HOST=localhost CONSOLE_PORT=2345 docker compose -f agent/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# Access TUI directly
docker exec -it lumenmon-console python3 /app/tui/main.py
```

### Python Development (TUI)
```bash
# Python dependencies (installed in Docker, but for reference)
pip install rich textual plotext pyperclip

# No specific linting/testing commands defined yet
# GitHub Actions uses: black, isort, flake8, pylint, mypy
```

## Installation

### Quick Install
```bash
# Console installation
curl -sSL https://lumenmon.run | bash

# Agent installation with invite (one-line)
curl -sSL https://lumenmon.run | LUMENMON_INVITE="<invite_url>" bash

# Manual agent installation
curl -sSL https://lumenmon.run | bash -s agent
```

### Installer Scripts
- `install.sh`: Main entry point, checks requirements, routes to appropriate installer
- `installer/console.sh`: Console-specific installation
- `installer/agent.sh`: Agent-specific installation
- `installer/menu.sh`: Interactive menu for installation options
- `installer/cli.sh`: Sets up `lumenmon` command symlink
- `installer/status.sh`: Shared status output functions
- `installer/uninstall.sh`: Complete removal script

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. Agents collect metrics at intervals (CPU: 0.1s, Memory: 1s, Disk: 60s)
2. Metrics sent as TSV through SSH: `timestamp\tagent_id\tmetric\ttype\tvalue\tinterval`
3. Console SSH ForceCommand routes to gateway script → storage in `/var/lib/lumenmon/hot/`
4. TUI reads from tmpfs-mounted directories for real-time display

### Directory Structure
- `console/`: Dashboard container
  - `tui/`: Python Textual-based TUI application
    - `views/`: Dashboard and detail views
    - `models/`: Agent, metrics, invite data models
    - `services/`: Monitor and clipboard services
    - `config/`: Settings and theme CSS
  - `core/`: Shell scripts for SSH, enrollment, ingress
    - `status.sh`: Comprehensive console status checks
  - `data/`: Persistent agent data and SSH keys (gitignored)

- `agent/`: Metrics collector container
  - `collectors/`: Metric collection scripts (CPU, memory, disk)
  - `core/`: Registration and connection scripts
    - `status.sh`: Comprehensive agent status with connectivity checks
  - `data/`: SSH keys and config (gitignored)

- `installer/`: Installation and setup scripts
  - Modular, self-contained installers following KISS principles
  - Consistent status output format across all scripts

- `lumenmon.sh`: Main CLI script in repo root
  - Smart defaults: no args opens TUI or shows status
  - Single-letter aliases for common commands
  - 57 lines of clean, maintainable bash

### Security Model
- SSH key-based authentication only (no passwords)
- Per-agent Linux users in console container
- ForceCommand prevents shell access
- Agent data isolated by user permissions

## Key Implementation Details

### Console TUI (`console/tui/`)
- Built with Python Textual framework
- Main entry: `main.py` - handles app lifecycle and routing
- Dashboard view shows agents table and invites
- Detail view shows real-time graphs using plotext
- Refresh rate configurable in `config/settings.py`

### SSH Enrollment Flow
1. Console creates invite: `/app/core/enrollment/invite_create.sh`
2. Agent registers: `/app/core/setup/register.sh <invite_url>`
3. Console creates dedicated user and sets up SSH access
4. Agent connects and starts streaming metrics

### Metric Storage
- Hot data: `/var/lib/lumenmon/hot/<agent_id>/` (tmpfs)
- Files: `cpu.tsv`, `memory.tsv`, `disk.tsv`, `meta.tsv`
- Format: TSV with timestamp, agent_id, metric_name, type, value, interval

### Status Scripts
Both `console/core/status.sh` and `agent/core/status.sh` provide comprehensive checks:
- **Agent**: SSH key, agent ID, console config, network ping, host fingerprint, SSH connection, metrics flow
- **Console**: Host key, SSH service, authorized keys, active invites, connected agents, active agents (< 60s data)
- Compact output format with clear status indicators: ✓ (success), ✗ (failure), ⚠ (warning), ○ (neutral)

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Metrics
1. Create collector script in `agent/collectors/`
2. Add to agent's main loop in `agent/agent.sh`
3. Update TUI models in `console/tui/models/metrics.py`
4. Add visualization in `console/tui/views/detail.py`

### Modifying TUI
- Theme: Edit `console/tui/config/theme.css`
- Layout: Modify views in `console/tui/views/`
- Data models: Update `console/tui/models/`
- Keybindings: Edit `BINDINGS` in `console/tui/main.py`

### Debugging
- Container logs: `docker logs lumenmon-console` or `lumenmon logs`
- Agent debug output: Check `agent/data/debug/`
- SSH issues: Verify keys in `console/data/ssh/` and `agent/data/ssh/`
- TUI issues: Run directly with `docker exec -it lumenmon-console python3 /app/tui/main.py`
- Status check: `lumenmon status` for comprehensive system state
