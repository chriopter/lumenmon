# Mosquitto ACL - Pattern-based topic isolation
# Applied only to port 8884 (external TLS listener with authentication)
# Port 1883 (internal, no ACL) allows full anonymous access for mqtt_to_sqlite.py

# Security model: Agents can only WRITE to their own topics, cannot read anything
# This prevents agents from:
# - Reading other agents' data
# - Subscribing to wildcard topics
# - Accessing console-only topics

# All authenticated agents: write-only access to their own metrics
pattern write metrics/%u/#
